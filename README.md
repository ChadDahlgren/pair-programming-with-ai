# Pair Programming with AI

## Project Overview

This repository contains the web development project for CIS300 - Fundamentals of Computer Science. This project demonstrates modern web development practices and technologies while teaching software engineers how to treat AI as a true programming partner.

## Project Description

**Pair Programming with AI** is an educational website that teaches software engineers how to collaborate with AI tools like Cursor, ChatGPT, and Copilot as if they were teammates. The site focuses on methodology, communication, and strategy rather than just using AI as a code generator.

### Mission

To teach developers a structured way to work with AI tools as pair programmers, boosting creativity, productivity, and software quality by improving how humans "think with" AI instead of simply asking it to fix problems.

### Problem Addressed

Most engineers use AI as a shortcut instead of a partner. They get frustrated when the AI doesn't "just know" what they mean. This site shows that treating AI like a human collaborator with context, intent, and iteration leads to better results.

### Why This Matters

Developers were never taught to communicate with AI effectively. The skillset to lead and collaborate with intelligent systems is new. There's a gap between code literacy and AI fluency that this project bridges through real-world examples and methods.

## Target Audience

Software developers, engineering students, and technical leaders who use AI in their daily work. Typically ages 20-60, tech-driven, curious, and motivated by efficiency and innovation. They enjoy learning new workflows and value pragmatic teaching that applies to real projects. The audience spans all genders and socioeconomic backgrounds.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Modern CSS frameworks (Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS)
- Video embedding for demonstration content
- Interactive code examples

## Content Plan

### Text Content

- Short articles on pairing philosophy and communication tips
- Prompt structures and code examples showing human-AI collaboration
- Methodologies for effective AI collaboration

### Graphics

- Screenshots of real prompts and conversations with AI
- Diagrams of interaction loops (human → AI → refine → build)
- Illustrations comparing "AI thought" vs "human thought" and how they align

### Media

- Short demonstration videos showing live pair programming sessions
- Quick visual explainers comparing human collaboration with AI workflows

### Downloads

- Example prompts or "rulesets" from Cursor
- Worksheets for developers to structure their AI conversations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pair-programming-with-ai
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser or use a local development server:

   ```bash
   # Using Python (if installed)
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Using Node.js (if installed)
   npx http-server
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow HTML semantic structure
- Use CSS best practices (BEM methodology recommended)

### File Organization

- Keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate files
- Use descriptive file and folder names
- Organize assets in appropriate directories

### Version Control

- Make frequent, small commits with descriptive messages
- Use feature branches for new functionality
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable
