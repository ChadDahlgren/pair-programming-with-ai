                <h2 class="section-title">Working with AI</h2>

                <p>AI is changing how we build software. Tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Copilot can understand
                    code, generate solutions, and help you reason through problems. The potential is real. But AI is
                    still a tool. And like any tool, you have to learn how to use it.</p>

                <p>It's easy to get frustrated. The model loops. It forgets what you told it. It gives you something
                    that almost works but doesn't. You can end up treating it like a fancy autocomplete—useful for
                    boilerplate, unreliable for anything complex. Or you can learn to use it well. With the right
                    approach, AI becomes a way to rapidly build production-quality code, think through hard problems
                    faster, and multiply what you're capable of shipping.</p>

                <p>This page covers two methodologies you can incorporate into your everyday work. <a
                        href="#orchestration"><strong>The Orchestration Model</strong></a> treats AI like a
                    development team. You distribute work across multiple conversations, each with a specific role
                    and scope. This prevents context overload and mirrors how real engineering teams operate. <a
                        href="#pair-programming"><strong>Pair Programming</strong></a> treats AI like a colleague
                    sitting next to you. You think out loud, iterate together, and work through problems
                    collaboratively. This mode works inside orchestration or on its own.</p>

                <div class="content-image">

            </section>

            <section class="content-section" id="orchestration">
                <h2 class="section-title">The Orchestration Model</h2>

                <p>The core idea: don't treat AI as one assistant that handles everything. Treat it like a team.</p>

                <p>When you dump an entire problem into a single conversation—architecture, implementation, testing,
                    documentation—you're asking one entity to juggle too much. Context piles up. The model gets
                    confused. You end up in loops.</p>

                <p>Instead, distribute work across multiple chats. Each conversation has a specific role and focused
                    scope. You coordinate the pieces the same way you'd coordinate a real development team.</p>

                <h3>Role Levels</h3>

                <p>These aren't different AI models. They're different conversation contexts with specialized
                    prompts and constraints. You define the role by how you frame the conversation.</p>

                    <img src="images/the-ladder.png" alt="Distributed Team Approach">
                </div>

                <h3>The Workflow</h3>

                <p><strong>Start with acceptance criteria.</strong> A user story, a PBI, or just a clear statement
                    of what you're building.</p>

                <p><strong>Break it into phases.</strong> Use your orchestrator chat to decompose the work. Ask:
                    "What are the major phases for building this?" You don't need perfect clarity upfront—let the
                    process reveal what you need.</p>

                <p><strong>Generate prompts for each phase.</strong> Your orchestrator writes the instructions for
                    specialist chats. This ensures consistency and proper context handoff.</p>

                <p><strong>Distribute to specialist chats.</strong> Architecture goes to an architect chat.
                    Implementation goes to senior or mid-level chats. Boilerplate goes to junior chats. Each
                    conversation stays scoped to its task.</p>

                <p><strong>Bring results back.</strong> When a specialist finishes, return to the orchestrator.
                    Report what's done. Get the next task. The orchestrator maintains the thread while specialists
                    stay focused.</p>

                <h3>Managing Handoffs</h3>

                <p><strong>When to start a new chat:</strong> When the task has a different scope than your current
                    conversation. Switching from architecture to implementation? New chat. Debugging to new feature?
                    New chat. Fresh context is a feature.</p>

                <p><strong>What to include in a handoff:</strong> Clear scope (what this chat handles), necessary
                    context (decisions already made), and success criteria (what "done" looks like). Think of it
                    like a well-written ticket.</p>

                <p><strong>Returning to orchestrator:</strong> "Email validation complete, tests passing, ready for
                    integration." The orchestrator tracks progress and sequences the next task.</p>

                <h3>Practical Example</h3>

                <p>I use one chat as my orchestrator throughout a project. When it identifies a task like "build
                    email validation," I open a new chat, paste the task specification, complete the work, then
                    report back. The orchestrator decides what's next.</p>

                <p>This mirrors how I manage my actual engineering teams. I don't give one person every task. I
                    distribute work based on skill sets and coordinate the pieces. Same principle, new context.</p>

            <!-- Section 3: Pair Programming -->
            <section class="content-section" id="pair-programming">
                <h2 class="section-title">Pair Programming</h2>

                <p>Pair programming is for when you're deep in a specific problem and need to think it through. It
                    works inside orchestration (within a specialist chat) or on its own for focused work.</p>

                <p>The approach: treat AI like a colleague sitting next to you. Not commands and outputs.
                    Conversation.</p>

                <h3>Think Out Loud</h3>

                <p>Be verbose. Vomit everything you know and think. AI can handle messy input—in fact, it needs it.
                    The more context you provide, the better predictions it can make.</p>

                <p>I use voice-to-text to just talk through problems. Disagree with myself. Contradict. Work my
                    thoughts through. Half-formed ideas are fine. Stream of consciousness is fine. All of it is
                    useful signal.</p>

                <p>Share the scope of what you're trying to do. "Here's the real problem I'm solving. Help me break
                    it down." Don't hold back context because you think it's too much.</p>

                <h3>Ask Questions</h3>

                <p>Treat it like a conversation. "I'm not sure about this approach—what do you think?" "What am I
                    missing here?" "Is there a simpler way to do this?"</p>

                <p>The Jarvis model from Iron Man is actually right. Tony Stark doesn't just bark commands. He
                    thinks out loud, asks questions, works through problems in dialogue. That's effective AI
                    collaboration.</p>

                <h3>When to Start Fresh</h3>

                <p>Conversations get heavy. Responses start getting confused. The AI forgets things you established
                    earlier. This is normal—it means the context window is full of noise.</p>

                <p>When this happens, start a new chat. Summarize what you've figured out. Carry forward the
                    decisions that matter. Leave the cruft behind.</p>

                <p>A new chat is like taking a walk when you're stuck on a problem. You're not losing
                    everything—you're clearing your head. The important stuff stays with you.</p>

                <p>Knowing when to start fresh is one of the most valuable skills you can develop. Don't treat
                    conversations as investments you can't abandon. Treat them as tools you pick up and put down.
                </p>

                <h3>Inside Orchestration</h3>

                <p>Pair programming and orchestration work together. Your orchestrator breaks down a problem and
                    assigns you a task. In that specialist chat, you're pairing—thinking out loud, iterating, asking
                    questions. When context gets heavy, you start fresh with a clean summary. When the task is done,
                    you return to the orchestrator.</p>

                <p>The modes aren't separate. They're different tools for different moments in the same workflow.
