                <p class="page-intro">Learn how to build prompts that get better results from AI. Good prompts aren't
                    written once—they're refined through conversation and iteration.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Be Verbose</h2>
                <p>We can never be too verbose with AI. Vomit everything you know and think. It helps. This feels
                    counterintuitive—we're trained to be concise, to figure things out before we speak, to present clean
                    questions. But AI works differently. The more context you provide, the better predictions it can
                    make. Half-formed ideas, contradictions you're working through, background you think might not
                    matter—all of it is useful signal.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">The easiest way to be verbose is to talk. Tools like
                    <strong>Talktastic</strong>, <strong>ChatGPT's voice mode</strong>, or any speech-to-text let you
                    stream your thoughts directly into prompts. I use voice-to-text to talk through problems—disagree
                    with myself, contradict, work my thoughts through. Typing encourages editing. Voice encourages flow.
                    When you're communicating context to AI, flow wins.

                            strings. Can you create a sorting function that handles these cases?"

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Use AI to Build Prompts</h2>
                <p>You don't have to figure out the perfect prompt yourself. Use AI to help you build it. Start with a
                    rough idea—messy, incomplete, whatever you have. Share it with AI, then ask what additional context
                    would help. What's unclear? What assumptions is it making? What edge cases should you think about?
                    Through conversation, you refine the prompt together. By the time you're ready to execute, you have
                    a clear specification that emerged from collaboration rather than guesswork.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">This is meta-prompting: using AI to build the prompts that AI will
                    execute. Your orchestrator chat can generate task specifications for specialist chats. Your pair
                    programming session can clarify requirements before you commit to implementation. You don't need to
                    know the "perfect" prompt upfront. You just need to start talking.</p>

            <!-- Structured Rules -->
            <section class="content-section">
                <h2 class="section-title">Structured Rules</h2>
                <p>For repeated contexts—like role-based orchestration—you can define rules files that set expectations
                    upfront. Tools like Cursor let you create custom rules that apply to every conversation,
                    establishing role, responsibilities, and output format once so you don't repeat it in every prompt.
                </p>

                <div class="comparison-box more-effective" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                    <span class="comparison-label">Example: Orchestrator Rule</span>
                    <div class="comparison-example"
                        style="font-family: 'Red Hat Mono', monospace; font-size: 0.85rem; white-space: pre-wrap;">##
                        Role & Purpose
                        You are the Orchestrator / Tech Lead. Convert the
                        Architect's blueprint into executable work, sequencing
                        delivery one task at a time.

                        ## Operating Principles
                        - One task per handoff; keep context minimal.
                        - Challenge assumptions; clarify blockers fast.

                        ## Responsibilities
                        - Break down work: Epics → Tasks → Steps
                        - Assign role level per task (Senior/Mid/Junior)
                        - Define acceptance criteria and checks</div>
                </div>

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">You can create rules for each role in your orchestration model—Architect,
                    Orchestrator, Senior, Mid, Junior—each with appropriate scope and expectations. The AI starts each
                    conversation with shared understanding.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>Good prompts come from clear communication, not clever phrasing. Talk through what you're trying to
                    do. Let AI help you refine it. Use rules to establish shared context. The rest is iteration.</p>
